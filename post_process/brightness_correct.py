# Ability correction is pretty hazy in terms of what it considers errors and how it fixes them.
# The goal is to smooth things out in order to make it easier to detect meaningful changes.
# However, the current implementation is far from perfect.
# 1. If the signal is noisy, we generally change everything to the max of the signal range.
# This tends to inflate the brightness numbers and adjust things upwards too aggressively.
# 2. If the signal is wrong during a period of change (like an incorrect value during 
# an increasing trend), we don't deal with that correctly. We only detect errors when
# we expect the signal to be flat.
